## Install Tesseract

The fishing bot depends on Tesseract, which is an optical character recognition (OCR) engine that is used to convert scanned images of machine-printed and handwritten text into digital text. You can find the latest version [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki).

Make sure to specify the path to `tesseract.exe` in `main.py`.
